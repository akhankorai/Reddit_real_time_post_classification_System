mentalhealth,1pc2573,Are men under 30 ruined?,"I’m in my early 50s. White dude from a small farm town. My generation had its problems. Divorce. Alcoholism. Drug abuse. Bullying. Abusive parents. Dysfunctional extended family. School authorities were corrupt. Cops sucked. The most repugnant edgelords of my generation were probably Nirvana and Beavis and Butthead - both culturally cataclysmic. They seemed to point out a problem with cathartic noise or a healthy sense of humor. But being stupid, ignorant or mean was never a cause to be celebrated. The cultural implication seemed to be that those traits were still meant to be resisted and aged out of. Until then, skateboarding and playing rock ‘n’ roll would get me through.

It was a fucking paradise compared to now. I’m speaking of the post-internet reality for young men specifically.

The lives of men raised online seem to have been completely retarded. Their lives were deprived of the development of mirror neurons or authentic chances to experience empathy or whatever family system they grew up in was completely usurped by the internet and video games and people behaving very, very, very badly online. Either way, the result seems to be that their moral compass is based on the indulgence of other people’s worst fantasies.

Now it is completely normal for someone to go online and spew the most dissociated, vile hate I’ve ever had the displeasure of being witness to.

Nirvana and Beavis and Butthead gave way to the “I don’t care if you don’t care” attitude of the 2000s which gave way to 4Chan and the celebration of not just ignorance, but of abject cruelty. I argue it's what has landed us here.

I know that there are always generational divides. I’m aware that this could be construed simply as a “get off my lawn” letter. But I always have always advocated for kids - especially when other adults didn't. ""Adults"" don’t know what they’re doing most of the time anyway.

But this recent thing - this is not “you crazy kids with your loud music and your long hair running off to rock concerts, getting drunk on the weekends or dropping out of school to travel in Europe.” It’s not “I’m worried about this rap or Satanic Heavy Metal music you listen to” or “you play too much Nintendo - go outside and ride your bike.”

This is celebrating Hitler. Incels. Groypers. It’s the glorification of hate and the killing of other people - specifically the most vulnerable among us.

This seems to be a completely ubiquitous epidemic of mental illness the likes of which we have never seen as a species, but it seems to be the only perceivable reality for certain young men.

Entire generations are throwing their lives into the meat grinder of a 24 hour news cycle. Seems to me that's nothing but a dark fiction with a shit ending for everyone. But I also don’t see this going away with the wisdom of old age. I argue that we either fix this or we fix nothing.

Young men - am I wrong or right? If so, please tell me why.",Unknown,123,164,1764659827.0,2025-12-02 07:17:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1pc2573/are_men_under_30_ruined/,im early white dude small farm town generation problems divorce alcoholism drug abuse bullying abusive parents dysfunctional extended family school authorities corrupt cops sucked repugnant edgelords generation probably nirvana beavis butthead culturally cataclysmic seemed point problem cathartic noise healthy sense humor stupid ignorant mean never cause celebrated cultural implication seemed traits still meant resisted aged skateboarding playing rock n roll would get fucking paradise compared im speaking postinternet reality young men specifically lives men raised online seem completely retarded lives deprived development mirror neurons authentic chances experience empathy whatever family system grew completely usurped internet video games people behaving badly online either way result seems moral compass based indulgence peoples worst fantasies completely normal someone go online spew dissociated vile hate ive ever displeasure witness nirvana beavis butthead gave way dont care dont care attitude gave way chan celebration ignorance abject cruelty argue landed us know always generational divides im aware could construed simply get lawn letter always always advocated kids especially adults didnt adults dont know theyre time anyway recent thing crazy kids loud music long hair running rock concerts getting drunk weekends dropping school travel europe im worried rap satanic heavy metal music listen play much nintendo go outside ride bike celebrating hitler incels groypers glorification hate killing people specifically vulnerable among us seems completely ubiquitous epidemic mental illness likes never seen species seems perceivable reality certain young men entire generations throwing lives meat grinder hour news cycle seems thats nothing dark fiction shit ending everyone also dont see going away wisdom old age argue either fix fix nothing young men wrong right please tell
mentalhealth,1pc6t88,Bf’s mom covered my mouth while im having panic attacks. Is that abuse?,"Hi everyone. I really need an outside perspective because I feel shaken, confused, and honestly scared. I’m staying with my family right now, trying to process everything.

A few days ago I had a severe panic attack, the worst one I’ve ever had. Honestly idk becahse it was my first time experiencing it. My whole body froze up, I couldn’t move, I was crying uncontrollably, and I felt like I couldn’t breathe. I genuinely thought I was going to pass out. I thought i was having a stroke because my mom and grandpa had it. No one in the family has ever had mental health issues like panic attack so this is new to me.

My boyfriend tried to “handle” me for about an hour, but then he suddenly got frustrated. I kept begging him to take me to the hospital because I couldn’t breathe or move, but he refused. My mom lives 3 hours away and called him in the middle of the night, telling him to take me to the ER immediately — he still refused. He insisted I’d “be better at home” and told me he didn’t want to “wait in line at the ER for this.”

I told him I was terrified and begged, “Please don’t leave me alone, I’m scared,” and he said, “No, I’m tired of dealing with you.” Then he left me alone, closed the door, and almost turned off all the lights while I was frozen and screaming for help.

I kept crying and yelling that I couldn’t breathe. He eventually came back, not to help, but to yell: “Are you trying to get me arrested?! You’re waking the basement tenants!”

The next morning things got even worse. His mom came over, immediately yelling at me while I was still shaking, crying, and unable to move properly. At one point she said, “If you don’t stop, I’m going to slap you,” and then she covered my mouth with her hand while I was crying and struggling to breathe. And said oh you need to be taken away and be in a psych for a week.

I can’t describe how terrifying that felt. I literally could not move, can’t stop crying even though my brain wants to stop and someone put their hand over my mouth.

When my body slipped partly off the bed, they laughed and said, “Oh, now you can move.” His mom kept provoking me by saying, “What do you want to do, punch me?” “Go ahead punch me right now” while I could barely talk.

My boyfriend eventually said you can’t treat her like how you treat me. And she was flabbergasted. After i was taken to the hospital which was 12 hrs after the incident even though i was begging for 12 hrs to take me to the hospital, my family came to get me. So i slept with my family the whole time after. The next day he messaged me and said, “If you weren’t being a bitch, you’d be comfortable in bed and jn the office in the house right now.” In a very sarcastic tone.

I left and I’m staying with my family now. I don’t feel safe going back, but I also feel confused and guilty. I keep replaying everything and questioning myself.

Was this abuse? Or am I overreacting because I was scared and having a panic attack? They kept saying to me that they just didnmt know how to handle it that’s why thats there reaction.

mentalhealth,1pcfngh,how do i stop caring so much about myself?,"for the last few years i’ve been stuck in this loop of hating everything about myself. i keep trying hobbies (crocheting, painting, random diy stuff) hoping they’ll distract me from thinking about how i look or how dumb i feel… but honestly it just makes me feel worse. i end up thinking i’m even more useless because i suck at those things too.

the part that hurts the most is how i feel when i look at myself. i get so disgusted. i don’t even feel like a woman, just because i think i’m too ugly. i feel like literally nothing about me is good—every single part of me is messed up or ugly.

it makes me jealous of other women, and i hate that feeling. i’ve become so bitter watching everyone else be prettier, like there’s no point in my life if i look like this.

and it’s not just appearance. i feel stupid, like my personality is awful. i don’t really have close friends. just one, and we’re not that close. i’ve never had a boyfriend either, and it just makes me feel like my life is already over before it even started.

i’ve been feeling like this for around 3 years. i know therapy would probably help but i’m honestly terrified of going, and the therapists around where i live don’t seem great anyway.

i just… don’t know how to stop caring so much about myself in this toxic way. how do people do it? any advice?",XKXKXKXXKXKXK,7,6,1764698790.0,2025-12-02 18:06:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1pcfngh/how_do_i_stop_caring_so_much_about_myself/,last years ive stuck loop hating everything keep trying hobbies crocheting painting random diy stuff hoping theyll distract thinking look dumb feel honestly makes feel worse end thinking im even useless suck things part hurts feel look get disgusted dont even feel like woman think im ugly feel like literally nothing goodevery single part messed ugly makes jealous women hate feeling ive become bitter watching everyone else prettier like theres point life look like appearance feel stupid like personality awful dont really close friends one close ive never boyfriend either makes feel like life already even started ive feeling like around years know therapy would probably help im honestly terrified going therapists around live dont seem great anyway dont know stop caring much toxic way people advice

I go on social media apps speaking to multiple different girls hoping they'll send me nudes, I did this all throughout high school as well. I feel awful about it and everything I've ever done. I'm a monster in my own eyes. Relationships don't work for me, I have no confidence in myself and girls can see that. I'm starting to think about taking the easy way out more often as it would be so much easier than having to think about who I am as a person. I hate everything about me.

mentalhealth,1pbntu9,"My college roommate’s porn addiction spiraled so badly he got kicked out of the dorms, and I still don’t know how to process it","So… this is something I never expected to write, but after everything that happened this semester, I need to get it out of my system.

I go to a pretty normal mid-sized university. Nothing fancy. At the start of the year, housing assigned me a random roommate—let’s call him *D*. When we first met, he seemed quiet, awkward, but friendly enough. He was a comp-sci major who mostly kept to himself, liked energy drinks a little too much, and played a ton of gacha games. Honestly, he reminded me of half the guys I know.

Everything seemed normal for the first month. He’d stay up late, but whatever—college. Then slowly… things got weird.

At first, I noticed he’d close his laptop really fast whenever I walked in. Again… fine. We’re all adults. But it kept happening. Sometimes at 3–4 AM when I’d wake up to use the bathroom and see the glow of his screen. Then I started finding tissues on the desk, earbuds on the floor, his laptop open with incognito tabs still visible. Awkward, but not a crisis… until it escalated.

The dude stopped going to class. Not just here and there—like WEEKS at a time. He barely left the room except to grab vending machine snacks. I’d come back from lectures and hear… very obvious audio coming from behind his headphones. Even when I made noise, even when I said I was entering. He just didn’t care anymore.

The turning point was when our RA did room inspections.

I had warned him the night before, and he said “yeah yeah, don’t worry.” Spoiler: he absolutely *did not* worry.

The RA knocked, we said come in, and D—**I swear to god**—still had a video playing on his screen. Full volume because his headphones had unplugged slightly. The RA just froze. I froze. D froze about two seconds later when he realized it wasn’t me who walked in.

The RA told him to close it, but you could tell he was trying to be professional while dying inside.

After that, we got a meeting scheduled with housing. I thought he’d get a warning. What I *didn’t* know was that this wasn’t D’s first report.

Apparently other people on our floor had complained earlier about weird noises through the walls, late-night slamming sounds, and someone seeing explicit content on his screen through the door window when walking past. They had talked to him before and he brushed it off.

Housing sent him to counseling. He skipped. They set up another meeting. He didn’t go. They warned him he could lose his dorm privileges if he kept violating behavior rules.

He kept doing it.

Fast-forward a bit: two weeks later, at around midnight, he was watching stuff with the volume ON—like, full speakers—because he “thought I wouldn’t be back for a while.” Someone on our floor called the RA again. This time it went straight up the chain.

Three days later, he was officially removed from on-campus housing for repeated conduct violations and refusing to comply with the support plan they tried to create for him. They gave him 24 hours to pack and leave.

It left me weirdly shaken. I can’t tell if I feel sorry for him, frustrated, secondhand embarrassed, or all of the above.

Anyway… thanks to anyone who actually read all this. I just needed to unload the story somewhere.",Levitating_Moose,38,286,1764620848.0,2025-12-01 20:27:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1pbntu9/my_college_roommates_porn_addiction_spiraled_so/,something never expected write everything happened semester need get system go pretty normal midsized university nothing fancy start year housing assigned random roommatelets call first met seemed quiet awkward friendly enough compsci major mostly kept liked energy drinks little much played ton gacha games honestly reminded half guys know everything seemed normal first month hed stay late whatevercollege slowly things got weird first noticed hed close laptop really fast whenever walked fine adults kept happening sometimes id wake use bathroom see glow screen started finding tissues desk earbuds floor laptop open incognito tabs still visible awkward crisis escalated dude stopped going class therelike weeks time barely left room except grab vending machine snacks id come back lectures hear obvious audio coming behind headphones even made noise even said entering didnt care anymore turning point ra room inspections warned night said yeah yeah dont worry spoiler absolutely worry ra knocked said come di swear godstill video playing screen full volume headphones unplugged slightly ra froze froze froze two seconds later realized wasnt walked ra told close could tell trying professional dying inside got meeting scheduled housing thought hed get warning didnt know wasnt ds first report apparently people floor complained earlier weird noises walls latenight slamming sounds someone seeing explicit content screen door window walking past talked brushed housing sent counseling skipped set another meeting didnt go warned could lose dorm privileges kept violating behavior rules kept fastforward bit two weeks later around midnight watching stuff volume onlike full speakersbecause thought wouldnt back someone floor called ra time went straight chain three days later officially removed oncampus housing repeated conduct violations refusing comply support plan tried create gave hours pack leave left weirdly shaken cant tell feel sorry frustrated secondhand embarrassed anyway thanks anyone actually read needed unload story somewhere
mentalhealth,1pci0ge,im thinking about giving up. i dont know who to reach out to,"
<18 f. i had to move to england 5 or so years ago from my home country due to political issues. ever since ive arrived i have felt the pressure to try extra hard since i felt like i was born with some sort of disadvantage compared to my friends who were born and raised in this country

this has recently gotten worse with exams. i began harming myself a year ago now, and i also have other coping mechanisms which im too ashamed to admit.

i dont know what to do. ive thought about giving up multiple times. nothing i do feels enough. im never happy with my grades or my talents or my extracurriculars. i dont see a future ahead of myself. 

i dont know how healthcare works here. my parents are already struggling and i dont want them to also pay money for my mental health. the free healthcare (nhs) has long queues and i dont exactly know how it works (like ive said) at some point considering reaching out began feeling pointless too.

i feel like im becoming a bad person. i feel jealous when my friends perform well, and i cant feel sorry for them when they vent about their problems (because in my head ""what theyre experiencing is nowhere bad enough"") i never tell this to them. i dont want to hurt the people around me but i can understand that these are not good thoughts to have. i am insecure.

i doubt many people will see this. i dont really know why im posting this here. it just feels like im living a life that nobody else can relate to and nobody else can truly understand. i just want to be happy with myself and i tried so hard to but i cant. im tired.

im meant to map out a future for myself by now. focus on my academics, my connections, my skills. but i cant see one for myself at all. my life feels like a waste

what do i do? is there anything i can do?",KittyMuffinx,3,3,1764703919.0,2025-12-02 19:31:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1pci0ge/im_thinking_about_giving_up_i_dont_know_who_to/,f move england years ago home country due political issues ever since ive arrived felt pressure try extra hard since felt like born sort disadvantage compared friends born raised country recently gotten worse exams began harming year ago also coping mechanisms im ashamed admit dont know ive thought giving multiple times nothing feels enough im never happy grades talents extracurriculars dont see future ahead dont know healthcare works parents already struggling dont want also pay money mental health free healthcare nhs long queues dont exactly know works like ive said point considering reaching began feeling pointless feel like im becoming bad person feel jealous friends perform well cant feel sorry vent problems head theyre experiencing nowhere bad enough never tell dont want hurt people around understand good thoughts insecure doubt many people see dont really know im posting feels like im living life nobody else relate nobody else truly understand want happy tried hard cant im tired im meant map future focus academics connections skills cant see one life feels like waste anything

I'm not religious, I don't believe in any god and don't want to. (For very good reasons. But I'm not in the mood to have discussions about that)

What's the point of life? Why am I here

I'm sorry if this is the wrong community to post this in but idk where else to post it.

Idk if this helps: I'm in therapy and taking medication prescribed by my psychiatrist. I have an autistic burnout. I'm always overstimulated, that's what the meds are for, but they don't help. I think i have social anxiety and now I'm too scared to go to school. the anxiety makes my burnout worse. 
I don't have any hobbies, I spend my days lying in bed or walking around my room while listening to music. I don't enjoy doing anything and I don't have friends. There's nothing I look forward to which makes it quite difficult to wanna live, so I REALLY need a reason to live or a point in life.

mentalhealth,1pcitrr,surviving school with MDD,"I am a 16 (almost 17) year old girl in my junior year of hs. My entire life I’ve subconsciously known that something was a little off with me mentally. I used to be really emotionally reserved even though I had many friends and I always felt that I have low self worth. It got a lot worse/apparent during Covid but then during middle school it kind of “went away” (although I now know that it never went away but rather always stayed at the back of my mind). Fast forward to the end of my sophomore year and I started skipping school because of my mental health but I was still able to keep up with my grade; I was getting A’s while taking AP classes. This year, I have taken 7 AP classes because that is what it takes to keep my rank in the top 5 percent (but now I have dropped a bit lower). In the past three weeks my mental health has gotten SIGNIFICANTLY worse and all of a sudden I have no motivation, extreme fatigue, and I am CONSTANTLY in a state of depression. Any happiness I feel is fleeting and very rare. For the first time in my life I am failing all of my classes and I have around 13 absences. I was diagnosed with MDD yesterday and I’m scared. I don’t want to fail my classes because my entire life I’ve been a straight A student and I want to go to a relatively good college. My school counselor has been no help when it comes to me keeping up with my classwork and my teachers, to my surprise, have not noticed that anything is wrong even though I went from A’s to failing (I’m talking like getting 25’s in some classes rn).

mentalhealth,1pcadcn,"Incident happened with mom, now I am remembering things.","I am 43(M) if that matters. 

About a month ago, I went to my parents' house to visit my mom. I knew dad was at work, but was just stopping by to say hello. Walked in on mom with another man. Anger instantly went through the roof, I told the guy to get dressed and get TF out. 

I yelled at mom, very harshly. She needed to hear those words, and after I left I have not been in contact with her whatsoever. Dad is doing OK.  Much better than I would be in this situation. 

  
It took me a solid two weeks to calm my mind down about that situation to be able to form rational thoughts about things. In doing this, bits and pieces from the past, say when I was age 7 - 12 keep popping into my mind, and when thinking about them now, it sure seems like mom has been cheating on dad for a while. 

  
I keep having random memories come out now since that day, and I don't know how to feel about it. Is my own personal mental health collapsing? I can still function just fine daily, it just is worrisome that I can just be plugging away at work and all of a sudden, my brain is in 1992 and a confused kid.  Easy enough to snap out of, but it is something I am not familiar with. 

Is this common after an incident like this?

  
Thanks for reading.

What happened today... my gut is not okay today since morning but it's not the worst either. And tbh I have handled even worse.

mentalhealth,1pc68wq,Feeling empty at 27,"Hey so.. I’m turning 28 this December, but Im feeling empty as hell.. I’m miss my ex, I was in an international student in the UK when I met her and has graduated for a master degree. We fall in love fast and I could say she was the best person I’ve ever met… lots of good memories. The only issue is that she wasn’t too well off financially and was doing part time jobs; but luckily I was able to make some money from investing .we’d went to all over the places in London and near by villages, hanging out in Chinatown, cooking together, went to movies & gigs, I also made some bold promises that I’d took care of her forever ,but she was super down to earth and kind that she still split the bill every time she could knowing how much I’ve made, we loved each other so much and that was the best thing that’s ever happened in my life.

Then things went downhill, made some stupid investment mistakes and was no longer enough to support my living in the UK (rents.. daily expenses. etc) I was struggling to try to make it all back but I failed and failed.  She even came visit my country (China) multiple times… met my family, travel and everything.. but I knew I couldn’t promise her anything now as it’s going to be too selfish to ask her to give up everything she had back home and just stay with me in China, let alone ask her to walk away the career she just started to build….

Unfortunately we made the decision of breaking up this March after some really, really sad conversations. And I felt emotionally empty ever since, I felt like I failed her by not able to keep the promises I said, hated myself for failing in my investment career and my inability to find a job in the UK… I could’ve really made it… I was so, so, so close to be able to provide the life we wanted. I don’t know if I’m able to meet anyone that’s as kind and warm as her.. 

It’s been 9months and I still thinking about it everyday, she was my absolutely best friend, love of my life, every weakness that I wouldn’t show to others (even my parents), I could express to her and she would always calm me down and made me feel better.  Now I’m just a guy in his late 20s who’s depressed and emotionally empty to start a new relationship. I’ve achieved absolutely nothing and sometimes just felt like a failure.

The good news is I’ve got a job offer from a big corporation in my city and will start next week. But I just can’t get over the fact that I was so close to fulfilling my promises to her.. and knowing it’s impossible for us to be together again absolutely breaks me whenever I thought bout it.

I don’t know if I’m able to become great at my job but I will try my best. Even I feel like it’s also kinda of a failure for myself to start a career at this age.

mentalhealth,1pcj1i6,"""When a girl has no friends, run.""","There's this thing lately I've been seeing a little on social media, where people say basically the thing in the title and it bugs me to no end.
They'll often specify that ""when someone has no friends you'll soon find out why"". Or they'll even mention if you have no one left from more than five years ago that's a red flag. 
Now, I don't have a lot of friends, definitely from a very long time ago. The main friend group I have have been described as toxic by my therapist, boyfriend and other friends, but bc they have been around for so long, I'm afraid to let them go. When I was a teen, I was quite weird. And throughout high school and uni I had trouble keeping friends, or making more than superficial friendships. I have AuDHD and up until I found out about that a few years ago the reason why I was seen as different was a big mystery to me, and I often felt like I was impossible to be friends with. 
Now I keep seeing those things on social media and I feel frustrated. Are people who have not made their friends by a certain age cursed to never have any?

mentalhealth,1pciz96,What to do after dropping out of college?,"The reason I wanted a degree was to get an office job to either make enough money or have good health insurance for my medication that cost $4k a month.

I’m a year away from graduating, and I can’t do it anymore. I used to be an honor roll student - I was even on the Dean’s List two years ago - but with each year my attendance and grades slip more and more. I took an academic leave for a semester or two to get my anxiety and depression sorted out, and when I came back, I was doing really well the first half of the semester. Perfect attendance. 

I started spiraling after I was assigned a group project with unresponsive groups mates, and I ended up not showing up to present it even though I had done the project. Then I dropped the class. I tried my best to move forward, but that really dampened my outlook on this semester and mornings started being dreadful again. I stopped going to class and stopped doing assignments. I couldn’t catch up if I tried, of which I don’t even want to. I don’t even feel bad about it, but I just know I won’t like the consequences of my decisions. I’m weirdly numb.

It’s unfortunate because my exam grades when I was attending classes ranged from 80-100. I was doing so well. That gives me hope that I can just stick it out, but I really don’t think I can do it anymore. I don’t want to get out of bed in the morning. I get stressed thinking about traffic, parking and unreliable public transportation. I get stressed about not participating enough in class, not networking enough, not having any friends on campus, not being smart or social enough, not having any internship experience, being bad at interviews, everything. I’m stressed about money. 

I spent all my savings on college and currently owe my parents money. Because of that I think I have to cut my losses and drop out before I waste any more money. But I also don’t know what I’d do after college. Working a job that pays $12 an hour for the rest of my life is not enough for my medication. My parents also won’t be around forever. How am I going to live off that wage?

I’ve tried medication and therapy to no avail. I had disability accommodations but stupidly didn’t renew them for this semester. It did help last semester, but barely and I felt like a liar the whole time. I’ve contacted my advisor and am awaiting a response. Any advice in the meantime would be appreciated.",jesthingjester,1,1,1764706085.0,2025-12-02 20:08:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1pciz96/what_to_do_after_dropping_out_of_college/,reason wanted degree get office job either make enough money good health insurance medication cost k month im year away graduating cant anymore used honor roll student even deans list two years ago year attendance grades slip took academic leave semester two get anxiety depression sorted came back really well first half semester perfect attendance started spiraling assigned group project unresponsive groups mates ended showing present even though done project dropped class tried best move forward really dampened outlook semester mornings started dreadful stopped going class stopped assignments couldnt catch tried dont even want dont even feel bad know wont like consequences decisions im weirdly numb unfortunate exam grades attending classes ranged well gives hope stick really dont think anymore dont want get bed morning get stressed thinking traffic parking unreliable public transportation get stressed participating enough class networking enough friends campus smart social enough internship experience bad interviews everything im stressed money spent savings college currently owe parents money think cut losses drop waste money also dont know id college working job pays hour rest life enough medication parents also wont around forever going live wage ive tried medication therapy avail disability accommodations stupidly didnt renew semester help last semester barely felt like liar whole time ive contacted advisor awaiting response advice meantime would appreciated

mentalhealth,1pcitgo,Opinions on in-patient treatment- Canada specific,"Hi all, I hope this reaches someone who can help. I'm Cece, I just turned 20 a few weeks ago. I have been struggling with mental health since I was around 8. I have diagnosed PTSD, ADD, anxiety and depression (ofc lol). I also have PCOS, which is not mental, but does greatly affect my mood lol. I've struggled with an ED, but never got severely ill (stopped before being underweight, back to what I was before). I am SURE I have OCD, just never finished the process of dx. I have tried therapies (CBT and DBT), meds (zoloft, escitalopram, sertraline, wellbutrin, etc.). I am coming off of wellbutrin rn, so I know that this is likely due to that, but I have been struggling for a while regardless. The biggest issue is the desire to voluntarily cancel my life subscription. I haven't, and do not SH, but the thought is ever present and louder than it ever has been. I feel like I am losing my mind. I have exams coming, but can't bring myself to really do anything. I feel stuck, I have no real hobbies or anything. I go out with friends and to my classes, but that's it. I am not progressing in life, as my mom said. I am genuinbely so stuck, and afraid to leave the house. I do, but I feel like I am being watched. There is no history of mental health issues (specifically stuff like schizophrenia or bipolar) in the family. I just don't know what to do. I think it may be time to entertain the idea of inpatient treatment, but I have no idea what to do. I've always been the ""good kid"", the one with good grades. But the first time I wanted to unalive myself was when I was around 9 or 10. So this is a severe, ongoing issue that appears resistant to like... everything. Everywhere I have looked is only for addictions. I do have coping strategies that are bad, but it is specifically maladaptive day dreaming, which has caused me to be so recluse. But it is also the only thing that has provided me comfort because I don't want to talk about my feelings and scare people. If anyone has any advice, warnings, has been here before, or ANYTHING, please tell me. I am afraid that I will ruin my future by choosing to be committed (if that is still an OK term to use? I am sorry if it's not), but I would need to actually have a future for that to be the case, if you know what I mean. Are inpatient places really as awful as people say they are?

mentalhealth,1pcil5d,I need suggestions for comforting my spouse,"My (38M) spouse (30NB) are both mentally ill. We both have depression and anxiety, I have ADHD (undiagnosed) and they are autistic (undiagnosed).

I was optimistic, but my spouse is not. Ever. So they’ve been struggling feeling like life is never going to get better, it’s only going to get worse.
If I say something like “I can see how this is really hard” and they’ll get frustrated at me. They don’t want me just repeating the bad thing back to them.
If I say “I’m sorry” they get fully mad at me because it’s empty to them.
They aren’t good with touch when overstimulated, they don’t want me to just sit there and silently listen to them either. Not do they want me even looking at them.
Seems like maybe they just want to process on their own, right? Nope. I’ve tried that as well and then they feel like I’m ignoring them entirely.

mentalhealth,1pc3wpf,I'm scared of going to a psychiatrist,"So. For some time, I really wanted to see a psychiatrist. Because I felt like I couldn't really function too much in therapy. Like even though I had around 3 sessions with a therapist, with each time, I started experiencimg more and more irrational fear to go again. I kept thinking I was way too worthless or that my psychologist hates me, etc, and it was just making me really depressed.

Then at some point I was in a horribly depressed mood. I was constantly crying, overwhelmingly sad, did not find pleasure in anything and it was like that every day. But I was too scared to go to a psychologist. So I thought maybe I should try a psychiatrist first. Maybe if I get medicated then I could function in therapy more

And so. My mom finally booked me a session with a psychiatrist. But honestly I'm really scared. It's today and I'm just wondering if I should cancel it. I don't really know if I need it that much anymore, because I'm not THAT depressed as I was before. But I'd still be so insanely scared of going to a psychologist. And even now, I'm really scared of going to the psychiatrist. I'm so bad at talking, I don't even know what I'm gonna say. I feel like I'm just gonna freeze or either not have the words. I mean that psychiatrist also does therapy so I guess that makes it better. But I really don't know what to do, I wonder if I should cancel it because I'm scared but at the same time.

mentalhealth,1pcbz70,"Obsessed with a fictional character,will I be thrown in a psych ward?","I'll try to be brief as possible,but it's been months that a lot of people (even my friends) want me to go see a therapist 

But I really don't want to see one, I know it may sound cringe or corny but I'm really obsessed with a fictional character, I love him so much
I post arts I make about him on TikTok and my friends said it's horrifying (most of the time, I draw him dead,me playing with his body like a doll, necrophilia (I think) me cutting myself 4 him,him licking the blood away blah blah blah...it's a long list of things I draw about him) 

I actually cut myself for him because I feel very close to him and happy when I do it (I'm sorry if it sounds cringe) he's always with me,and comfort me when I need him

Last year I had no friends at school (whomp whomp no wonder why) and he was the only one for me,he was always making me happy during class and next to me during breaks

I also have a lot fantasies about him which I'm uncomfortable to talk about it here because I don't know if the Reddit community is judgemental or not, I know a lot of people might think this post is cringe 

Anyways,he's everything to me, I must be grateful because he's always there with me and I feel less alone 

Now,if I say all of that to a therapist, I damn well know they're going to throw me in a psych ward and make me forget about him,and I don't even understand why

In my opinion,my obsession is not a big deal,but the more I hear people saying ""you need help"" ""you're crazy"" blah blah blah,the more I start questioning myself.
I mean, it's the internet, people are sensitive but, it's getting pretty ""annoying""

I really don't want ""help"" because I know they're going to lobotomize me or whatever and make me forget about him and there's no way.

mentalhealth,1pchfqh,"For people who don't feel that they're good enough, or feel like they are the problem itself.","People should believe in this inevitable fact that how others treated you proves everything about their own character and values. It has absolutely nothing to do with your own self worth. 

People percieve others the way they percieve themselves.

If they're insecure, they are adamant to make you feel the same about yourself. If they're rude and arrogant, they are down to 

The feeling that their treatment has eroded your own sense of self because of them is just the deep rooted trauma speaking. 
You are more than that. Your self worth is your own and nobody else's to use and turn it against you. 

Everyone else's problems is their own issue, it obviously has nothing to do with you and you do not need to devalue yourself for their own issues, unless you've hurt them and they explicitly told you that you did and you recognise it to be absolutely true and you didn't apologize for it. 

Believe me, you're not the problem, of you ever think you are. Most times it's just your mistakes, and who doesn't make one? 

So just keep moving forward. 
The magic is to never give up, where there is a will there is a way, when you have the resilience and inner instict to never ever give in to the lemons that life brutally throws on you, that's when you use them to make a delicious lemonade. 

There's always a solution to a problem and every problem feels like a dead end until it doesn’t. 
People survive because solutions tend to reveal themselves when we keep moving.

The first step towards healing is to ressurect the feeling of self love. It's become hidden from all the trauma, but you just need to bring it back to yourself again. 

Love yourself, be kind towards yourself and others, cuz forgiving others is where you finally come at peace in your life!

Wish you all a happy and fulfilling life ahead! (⁠ ⁠◜⁠‿⁠◝⁠ ⁠)⁠♡

mentalhealth,1pcg0ho,"22M — Need medical advice about my father’s post-stroke behavior changes, refusal of treatment, extreme anger, and delusional beliefs","**Age/Sex:** 22M  
**Height/Weight:** (Add your approx here, e.g., 5'8"" / 68 kg)  
**Medications:** I don’t take any.  
**Smoking/Alcohol:** Non-smoker, no alcohol, no drug use.  
**Past medical history:** None significant.  
**Current medical issues:** Anxiety due to family situation (not diagnosed).  
**Location:** India  
**Duration of complaint:** Ongoing for 1 year (father’s stroke, worsening behavior)

Hello doctors, I’m posting for advice because I’m the only son (22M) caring for my father who had a stroke one year ago, and his behavior has completely changed since then.

This is about **my father's medical condition**, but I am giving **my own demographic info** as required.

# About my father (patient):

* Male, mid-50s
* Had a stroke 1 year ago
* Physically recovered mostly
* But his personality and behavior changed drastically

# Current symptoms in my father:

* Extreme anger and irritability
* Verbal abuse, sometimes toward my mother
* Brings up old grudges
* Gets hyper quickly
* Slurred speech at times
* Very slow reaction time
* Occasional facial droop
* Believes only in religious rituals/puja
* Denies all medical problems
* Throws away medicines secretly
* Says “whatever is written will happen”
* Emotional crying during devotional songs
* Thinks doctors are a waste of money
* Constant fights in the family
* Suspicious of everyone

He also used to make flower garlands as a daily religious ritual and ignored his health completely — stopped sleeping on time, skipped meals, became weak, and still refuses to stop.

# Medical reports (brief):

* Scan shows old strokes
* Small vessel disease
* Mild brain atrophy
* Past lacunar infarcts

Doctors said: **physical damage is minimal now, but emotional/behavioral issues are from the brain changes.**

# Medications prescribed to my father recently:

* Risperidone + Trihexyphenidyl
* Divalproex ER
* Gabapentin + Nortriptyline
* Stroke prevention meds
* Vitamin B supplements

After taking them, he became calm but had slow speech and slow reaction time, and then refused medicines again.

# Main issues I need advice on:

1. **Is slow speech and delayed reaction normal after starting these psychiatric/stroke medicines?**
2. **How do families handle stroke patients who deny they are sick?**
3. **What can we do if a patient refuses treatment entirely?**
4. **Can post-stroke behavioral changes improve over time with medication?**
5. **How dangerous is it when he has occasional facial droop episodes again?**
6. **What are the signs that this is a psychiatric issue vs. another stroke?**

# Personal situation (me):

I’m 22M, with two sisters and a mother at home. I’m the only son, financially limited, and this situation is mentally exhausting. My father’s behavior has caused serious emotional stress in the house. Sometimes I feel overwhelmed and don’t know how to help him, especially because he refuses treatment.

Thank you for reading. Any medical guidance would mean a lot.  
I will answer any follow-up questions.",prdpdezinn,1,1,1764699573.0,2025-12-02 18:19:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1pcg0ho/22m_need_medical_advice_about_my_fathers/,agesex heightweight add approx eg kg medications dont take smokingalcohol nonsmoker alcohol drug use past medical history none significant current medical issues anxiety due family situation diagnosed location india duration complaint ongoing year fathers stroke worsening behavior hello doctors im posting advice im son caring father stroke one year ago behavior completely changed since fathers medical condition giving demographic info required father patient male mids stroke year ago physically recovered mostly personality behavior changed drastically current symptoms father extreme anger irritability verbal abuse sometimes toward mother brings old grudges gets hyper quickly slurred speech times slow reaction time occasional facial droop believes religious ritualspuja denies medical problems throws away medicines secretly says whatever written happen emotional crying devotional songs thinks doctors waste money constant fights family suspicious everyone also used make flower garlands daily religious ritual ignored health completely stopped sleeping time skipped meals became weak still refuses stop medical reports brief scan shows old strokes small vessel disease mild brain atrophy past lacunar infarcts doctors said physical damage minimal emotionalbehavioral issues brain changes medications prescribed father recently risperidone trihexyphenidyl divalproex er gabapentin nortriptyline stroke prevention meds vitamin b supplements taking became calm slow speech slow reaction time refused medicines main issues need advice slow speech delayed reaction normal starting psychiatricstroke medicines families handle stroke patients deny sick patient refuses treatment entirely poststroke behavioral changes improve time medication dangerous occasional facial droop episodes signs psychiatric issue vs another stroke personal situation im two sisters mother home im son financially limited situation mentally exhausting fathers behavior caused serious emotional stress house sometimes feel overwhelmed dont know help especially refuses treatment thank reading medical guidance would mean lot answer followup questions
mentalhealth,1pcfew8,how do i get over someone that i lost because of myself,"the title says everything. im very lonely and i cant talk with anyone because i cant trust anyone. but she was a great person. she listened to me and didnt say “youre still young, you cant have problems”. after being friends for some time, we had a relationship for 11 or 10 months, and that was 2 years ago. we broke up because i was caught in my own problems rather than spending time with her. my texts was becoming less, i didn’t have the energy like before, and we were fighting too much. then one day she just said she wanted to break up and i didnt stop her. she cared and loved me more than i thought, which i noticed after we broke up. she was the only one i could ever trust, even more than my family. i regret “almost” everything i put her through, im not saying she didnt do anything wrong to me, im just saying my wrongs were more than hers. i regret lying, being careless, being emotionless and not loving her enough. as for the lying, i hate it. i hate myself for lying but i cant stop it, its like a reflex i dont know. i try to stop but i just cant. so i still think about her, see dreams/nightmares about her, listen to some songs she liked, and i started to follow after a hobby she had which i thought i would never spend time with (though im not sure if she really has that hobby but she would understand if she saw it).

so today i decided to text her about going to a movie (dont judge, she knows what kind of person i am. also i was thinking about this for the last 2 months), i mean i dont go to cinemas a lot because i dont want to do anything by myself, im just a potato if i got no one with me. whatever, i just texted her on whatsapp and i noticed she actually blocked me. i mean, i was already expecting it but i didnt know because she didnt have a pp while we were in a relationship. then i checked all the apps we texted through (just instagram), and she did the same on all of the apps. and that kind of hurts? i mean she really hates me that much? even after 2 whole years? we were kids. and she also asked about me to a mutual “friend” a few months after we broke up so thats why i thought she still cared. but maybe im too late even if im not on my mind. i feel like my hands are tied. no words from her for 2 years and now i find out i cant even reach out to her even if i want to.

i still want her in my life. but not as my gf, just as my friend. because when i look back i notice we wouldnt match up anyway, but we could be great best friends. and we were great before we decided to get on a relationship. i feel like i would get over her but i dont want to, because then i wouldnt have anyone left in my life. dreaming about her, remembering her voice, words, actions makes me happy. and theres nightmares i see with her, but i think thats just my self judgement, and i deserve them. if i could find a person that i could trust and i would really cared about me, or felt like her, i would be ready to forget her.

im sorry if i talked too much i only speak to myself and the words always messy and i dont even know if someone will actually read something this long. i tried to write my thoughts a lot of times so maybe i could get relaxed a bit but everytime i felt stupid for it and just threw them away. even now i feel like embarrassing myself while its anonymous. i would probably delete this too because after all this talking i dont know what i want right now. i started writing when i was down, now i feel empty. i talked too much again im sorry.",S4uL-Goodman,0,1,1764698291.0,2025-12-02 17:58:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1pcfew8/how_do_i_get_over_someone_that_i_lost_because_of/,title says everything im lonely cant talk anyone cant trust anyone great person listened didnt say youre still young cant problems friends time relationship months years ago broke caught problems rather spending time texts becoming less didnt energy like fighting much one day said wanted break didnt stop cared loved thought noticed broke one could ever trust even family regret almost everything put im saying didnt anything wrong im saying wrongs regret lying careless emotionless loving enough lying hate hate lying cant stop like reflex dont know try stop cant still think see dreamsnightmares listen songs liked started follow hobby thought would never spend time though im sure really hobby would understand saw today decided text going movie dont judge knows kind person also thinking last months mean dont go cinemas lot dont want anything im potato got one whatever texted whatsapp noticed actually blocked mean already expecting didnt know didnt pp relationship checked apps texted instagram apps kind hurts mean really hates much even whole years kids also asked mutual friend months broke thats thought still cared maybe im late even im mind feel like hands tied words years find cant even reach even want still want life gf friend look back notice wouldnt match anyway could great best friends great decided get relationship feel like would get dont want wouldnt anyone left life dreaming remembering voice words actions makes happy theres nightmares see think thats self judgement deserve could find person could trust would really cared felt like would ready forget im sorry talked much speak words always messy dont even know someone actually read something long tried write thoughts lot times maybe could get relaxed bit everytime felt stupid threw away even feel like embarrassing anonymous would probably delete talking dont know want right started writing feel empty talked much im sorry

They had to send me to the clinic because I ran off away from class and had so much of this pent-up energy I couldn't stop fidgeting rapidly in my seat that my teacher told me to stop. I was so extremely hysterical posting random shit here on Reddit before I went to school and outside that I couldn't breathe because I couldn't stop laughing.

I was laughing so hard in front of people who were clearly concerned about me because I was outside in hot weather walking around while I felt like I was on cloud nine and I was so confident that the people staring at me (since I tend to dress well in school) must be thinking I was handsome and I'm not normally that positive. It's for the first time being so physically attracted to my face that I masturbated a lot in front of the mirror because I felt so hot that I would fuck myself given the chance.

mentalhealth,1pcf993,Please help,"Hi everyone. I am a male(26). I work in an MNC and live with my parents as I have work from home. I also have a younger sister(19). So we are 4 people living together. My sister had been suffering from several mental health issues including depression, bipolar, OCD, suicidal thoughts. She was a bright student and during the covid lockdown we saw changes in her. She had beene goinf under psychiatric treatment. We have tried counselling as well but she refuses after the first meeting itself. Now she has not even completed her 12th and had been idle since 2021. She used to pursue some of her hobbies previously but has stopped that as well. So literally she dkes nothing. Her agression has now gone to extreme levels. She fights with us on a daily basis and been violent as well. Her anger is towards herself but she takes it out on us like we are her enemies. We have tried everything and we listen to all thr things she say. I can't explain everything here in detail but situation is extreme. We have lost all hopes now. Nothing can be done because she gives up everything in 2 days. Now I have been doing work from home for the past 1 year. Before that I was out of town for my college and different job. I have now started to be impacted because of her. My mental health is getting deteriorated. Whenever I hear her talking to my mom, I leave everything and try to hear them hoping it will be a normal conversation. My anxiety level increases as soon as hear as she gets out of control when she is angry and she is angry constantly. I am just unable to live in my house now. I already have so much stress relating to job, career, relationship. 

  
I have been planning to move out and live separately but then I start to feel guilty that I will leave my parents alone with her. Secondly, when things go extreme I had to come om between and try to calm her or sometimes playing some mobile games with her. But all of this takes a heavy toll on my mental health. My mom has already asked me to move out as she does not want me to see all this and go into depression myself.

mentalhealth,1pce90a,Took 400mg of sertraline over the past 24 hours,"F19, been on sertraline for a few years now. usual dose is 200mg (4 tablets) daily.

Yesterday, I forgot to take my usual 200mg dose of sertraline so I took it at 11 am today. And then just now at 12 am (which is 12+ hours since my last dose) I just took my 200mg dose for today. So, there's around 12 hours + gap between 200 mg dose and another 200 mg dose. Technically, I took 400 mg for the past 24 hours. Is it dangerous? Will it impact my health on a serious level? Should I be concerned?
